### Day-6: Javascript Loops and Conditional Statements
A loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Loops help avoid code repetition and make the code more efficient.
- What is loop and why we use it.
- What loops are available in Javascript.
- Syntax of while, do-while and for loop.

Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions based on different conditions.
  - if
  - if...else
  - if..else if...else
  - switch case
- Understanding control flow.

Control flow determines the execution order of statements in a program. JavaScript executes code line by line unless control structures (loops, conditions) alter the flow.
  
- Control transfer statements/keywords
  - break;
  - continue;
  - return;

### Day-7: Hoisting and Closures
#### Hoisting
Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving function and variable declarations to the top of their scope before execution.
